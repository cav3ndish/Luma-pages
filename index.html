            Cy Twombly, born on April 25, 1928, in Lexington, Virginia, USA, attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, 
            Washington and Lee University in Lexington, and the Art Students League in New York from 1948 to 1951. It was during this time that 
            he crossed paths with Robert Rauschenberg. Encouraged by Rauschenberg, he embarked on further studies at Black Mountain College in
             North Carolina from 1951 to 1952, under the guidance of influential teachers like Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, and Ben Shahn. 
             The Kootz Gallery in New York showcased Twombly's inaugural solo exhibition in 1951. Throughout this phase,
             Twombly's artistic expression bore the imprint of Kline's black and white expressionism and the whimsical imagery of Paul Klee. </p>

In 1942, he joined the anti-avant-garde movement Corrente. An anti-fascist, he actively participated in the Resistance between 1944 and 1945, and in 1946, in Milan, he signed the manifesto "Beyond Guernica." 
            In the same year, he was among the founders of the Nuova Secessione Italiana, later known as Fronte Nuovo delle Arti.
He started exhibiting in solo and group shows from the 1940s, quickly gaining international recognition. In 1951, 
the Catherine Viviano Gallery in New York dedicated a solo exhibition to him, solidifying his international reputation. Starting from 
the 1948 Venice Biennale, he participated in several editions of the event, receiving a solo exhibition in 1952, the Grand Prize for

             the limits of the canvas, interacting with the surrounding space.
             De Maria has exhibited in prestigious art events, including the Venice Biennale (1980, 1988, 1990), Documenta 7 in Kassel, Germany, the XVI São Paulo Biennale in Brazil, the IV Sydney Biennale in Australia, and the Rome Quadriennale.  </p>

               was trained as a graphic designer, but would go on to work in sculpture, painting, and later, photography and collage. His early works reacted against his perception of the beauty of Art Informel, and focused instead on the material and formal components of painting, like the canvas and the frame. He was known at times to eschew the use of paint in favor 
               of bare surfaces. Starting in the 1970s, his works became more conceptual, focused on the systems of creating and exhibiting art. </p>

        <h4 class="mt-5 artist-description">Francesco Clemente</h4>
        <p class="mt-3 artist-description">Italian painter Francesco Clemente came to prominence in the mid-1970s with vivid paintings rife with erotic imagery of mutilated body parts, gesturing amorphous figures often depicted in rich colors, as well as a series of contorted self-portraits. Fascinated with Indian art and mysticism, his gouache paintings and pastel drawings are especially noted for their intense and arcane quasi-religious content that has grown increasingly surreal in his later works. Though large in scale, Clemente’s work often conveys an uncanny and unabashed intimacy. 
              Clemente has been compared to such painters as Georg Baselitz and David Salle.</p>

               <p class="mt-3  artist-description">Giorgio Griffa belongs to a group of artists who transformed Italian art in the post-war era. Working with Giovanni Anselmo, Gilberto Zorio, Giulio Paolini, and Mario and Marisa Merz in mid-1960s Turin, Griffa himself received little international acclaim until well into his career —despite exhibiting at the São Paulo Bienal in 1977 and the Venice Biennale in 1978 and 1980. In the 21st century, his work has received greater recognition; he had solo exhibitions at the Centre d’Art Contemporain Genève in 2015 and London’s Camden Art Centre in 2018, in addition to another appearance at the Venice Biennale in 2017. Though never fully affiliated with Arte Povera, Griffa draws from the movement’s emphasis on materiality. In minimalist paintings, he reduces his materials and processes to their essential elements —raw canvas, color, and brushstrokes —and depicts rhythmic lines and squiggles made with performative gestures. His simple, unstretched canvases often reveal creases that have formed during storage, adding the suggestion of a grid to his compositions. </p>

                commitment to a form that can be perceived beneath the surface of the canvas as a fundamental sign while pursuing his artistic 
                radicalism. He never strayed from the aesthetic direction he had chosen. Turi Simeti’s work invites us to a spatial and meditative 
                experience of painting, a chapter in the monochromatic adventure that took place in the second half of the twentieth century in Italy and around the world.

            <p class="word-break text-center mt-4">Aldo Mondino was born in Turin in 1938, where he died in 2005.
                In 1959 he moved to Paris, where he attended William Heyter's studio, the Ecole du Louvre and attended the mosaic course at the Academy of Fine Arts with Severini and Licata.

                in Venice (1962). The meeting with Gian Enzo Sperone, director of the Il Punto Gallery, is fundamental for his artistic career, with a partnership that still exists. Important personal exhibitions are also presented 
                at the Stein Gallery in Turin, the Marconi Studio in Milan, the La Salita Gallery in Rome, the Galleria Paludetto in Turin.

            a group of artists based in Rome who, in the face of Fascism, embraced the principals of Futurism and Marxism. As one of the key 
            figures of abstract art in Italy during the time, Accardi developed an iconic visual lexicon of calligraphic marks that,
             when combined with her minimalist color palette and dynamic compositions, showcased the endless possibilities of abstraction. </p>

            He attended the Art Institute of Rome and graduated in photography in 1957, he trained on the example of Cy Twombly and gestural and informal painting.
His first public participation took place in 1959 together with Franco Angeli and Giuseppe Uncini, in a group exhibition at the La Salita gallery in Rome, where, only in 1961,
 he held his first personal exhibition.
Protagonist of the Roman pop school, he welcomed the new dada solutions with formal rigor, proposing isolated monochrome 
objects for everyday use. Famous are the shutters, mirrors and windows, which become the support of his activity as a painter. </p>
